**Project Title: Homework Assistant Chatbot**
https://homework-helper-steel.vercel.app/ 
**Overview:**

I developed a Homework Assistant Chatbot that utilizes Python for the backend, leveraging OpenAI's API to provide intelligent responses to user queries. The application is built using Flask, a micro web framework for Python, which handles the web server functionality and routes for the chat interface. For deployment, I used Vercel, a platform that simplifies the process of deploying web applications.

**Details:**

- **Backend**: The backend of the application is powered by Python and OpenAI's API. It processes user inputs and generates responses using the OpenAI language model.
  
- **Flask**: Flask is used to manage the web server and handle HTTP requests. It serves the front-end HTML page and processes user input to interact with the OpenAI API.
  
- **Deployment**: Vercel is used for deploying the application. It handles the deployment process and ensures that the app is accessible on the web.

**Features:**

- **Interactive Chatbox**: Users can interact with the chatbot to get homework help. The chatbot provides answers based on the prompts submitted by the user.
  
- **Static Assets**: Includes CSS for styling and JavaScript for dynamic interactions within the chat interface.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Python**: Backend logic and API integration
- **Flask**: Web framework for routing and serving the application
- **OpenAI API**: Provides intelligent responses based on user input
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform for hosting the web application
